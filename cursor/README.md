Custom modes
------------
Currently (as of 2025-06-04) you need to be on a beta version (0.51.x) of Cursor
to get custom modes.

Tony's favorite custom mode is one with the RIPER-5 prompt and using Claude 4
with thinking enabled.

Custom mode setup is saved in
`~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb` which
probably isn't great to have checked into this dotfiles-repo :/
