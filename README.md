dotfiles-malthe
===============
My hand-written dotfile setup.

Install
-------

    cd ~
    git clone git@github.com:malthejorgensen/dotfiles-malthe.git dotfiles
    python install.py

Alternatives
------------

**chezmoi**  
I tried chezmoi and it immediately deleted a bunch of my files.
So that was a no-go.
